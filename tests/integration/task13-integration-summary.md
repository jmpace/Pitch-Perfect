## Key Integration Validations

### ✅ **Perfect Timestamp Alignment**
Tests verify that frames extracted at 5-second intervals (00:05, 00:10, 00:15...) perfectly align with transcript segments (00:00-00:05, 00:05-00:10, 00:10-00:15...) for accurate multimodal analysis.

### ✅ **Visual-Verbal Mismatch Detection**
Integration tests validate that the system can identify specific misalignments (e.g., "Speaker says '50M users' but slide shows '45M users'") that wouldn't be caught by single-modality analysis.

### ✅ **Automatic Workflow Orchestration**
Tests confirm that analysis automatically triggers when both frame extraction and transcription complete, providing seamless user experience without manual intervention.

### ✅ **Cost Tracking Integration**
Validates that Anthropic API costs are automatically calculated and integrated with existing cost tracking (Vercel Blob, Mux API, OpenAI Whisper) to show complete per-video costs.

### ✅ **Error Recovery and Resilience**
Tests comprehensive error handling including network failures, API rate limits, malformed responses, and automatic retry mechanisms with proper user feedback.
