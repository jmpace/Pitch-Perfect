# Claude Code Development Notes

## Implementation Philosophy

"Build for the unified happy path first, add error handling second, optimize third - and choose boring, stable technology over cutting-edge."

## Context

This advice comes from implementing the unified Mux audio-only transcription architecture with large file support. The biggest architectural win was recognizing that **consistency trumps optimization** - the unified audio-only approach eliminated far more complexity than any performance optimization could have added.

## Key Learnings

- Start with end-state architecture rather than iterating through conditional logic
- Integration points matter more than implementation details
- Choose stable SDKs over experimental ones for production features
- Design for rate limits and cost constraints from day 1
- Frontend orchestration provides excellent user experience
- Real data testing reveals issues that mocks miss
- Cost optimization is architecture, not code optimization
- Good error messages are user experience
- Structured logging is production infrastructure
- Documentation enables better architectural decisions
